# KPN Security Policy created by the KPN CISO Office

Go to https://ciso-ksp.kpnnet.org for the latest KPN Security Policy.


## Move to a new platform and the end of the KSP Github channel
The KPN Security Policy was published on Github to openly and freely make our security, privacy and business continuity policy. We've made it available on Github for ease of use and a request from Twitter upon our initial publication through an iOS app.
We've move to our new platform completely and we've also ensured that external access to our policies remained open. However, we've decided to stop with our Github channel and offer an API for those whom wish to integrate our data and a web-interface with a direct database connection to our internal system. This will ensure our policy will stay as current as possible on the externally published side. Our content will therefor be archived, but available, through the Git tags for historical reasons.


## Content
The KPN Security Policy on physical security, information security, business continuity and privacy.

## Not published
The guideline documents and tools. The motivation is that we do not publish information that can be tied back to our internal processes as we consider this confidential information.

## Sharing is caring philosophy
We hope to inspire readers to learn about our choices and perhaps copy ideas. We are open for feedback to also learn from other experiences.
